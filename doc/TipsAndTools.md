# Tips and Tools

This file lists tips and tools used during this project. Hopefully, all of these follow the "Keep It As Simple As Possible" principle.

## Documentation
### Markdown Editor
I wrote my documents in Markdown format because it's text based, so it can be versionned and this is the format used by GitHub.

To wrote files in this format, i'm using the [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/) editor. I'm very happy with it. I'm using the 'blackboard' style for the editor part.

### URL Diagrams
When i want to draw some diagrams and particularly UML ones, i'm using [UMLet](http://www.umlet.com/). It's very simple, the save format is xml so you can use versionning efficently. You can print or save diagrams in png, gif or others formats.

## Coding
### Clojure for the server side
[Clojure](http://clojure.org/) : a lisp-like JVM language with persistent data and built-in multi-threading. So you have a REPL, a no syntax language.

### Clojurescript, HTML5, css for the client side
ClojureScript : a clojure to javascript compiler.

### Datomic for the data
Datomic is a time aware facts database in clojure with cloud deployment in mind.

## Project management
### Leiningen
No choice here ^^.

### Versionning with Github
Of course, [Github](https://github.com/cturle) for project repository. I've downloaded the [Windows client](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and it works fine.

I recommend checking github tutorials and look around to understand the fundamentals before using it.

### Time Tracking
I'm using [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com) to track time spent on my projects. It's an online tool really simple to use. Actually, i'm using it only to track my time spent on my PCA project. At first, i used to track lots of activities like net surfing, office work, home duties, gaming... It was a bad idea. So keep it simple and track only your projects.
